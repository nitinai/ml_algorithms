# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains bare minimum implementation of different machine learning algorithms in order to understand how those algorthms actually works.

## Implemented algoritms 
* [Decision trees](mllearn/ensemble/forest.py)
* [Random forests](mllearn/tree/tree.py)

Test cases has been written for all algorithms. You can be found them [here](mllearn/tests)

Please feel free to open an issue if you find a bug in implementation.

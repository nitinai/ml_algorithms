# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains bare minimum implementation of different machine learning algorithms. The main purpose of this project is to understand mechanics of these algorthms.

## Implemented algorithms 
* [Decision trees](mllearn/ensemble/forest.py)
* [Random forests](mllearn/tree/tree.py)

Test cases are written for all algorithms. You can be find them [here](mllearn/tests)

Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/nitinai/ml_algorithms/issues/new) if you find a bug in implementation.
